# Housing Price Prediction

# Brief Description :
In this project, we aim to practice machine learning and working in structured step-by-step workflow of a data scientist by predicting housing prices using Kaggle datasets. By analyzing various property features, we can make accurate predictions about housing prices. The project involves data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

# Setup
