# Collaborative Filtering Analysis and Implementation

## Project Overview

This is a collaborative group project for the course **DSA4212: Optimisation for Large-Scale Data-Driven Inference**. The project focuses on exploring collaborative filtering techniques, analyzing their effectiveness, and implementing them from scratch. We aim to predict user preferences and provide personalized content through a recommendation system.

## Project Objectives

- Develop a recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques, such as **Matrix Factorization** (ALS, GD).
- Analyze and compare different approaches in collaborative filtering.
- Implement the model from scratch to gain deeper insights into the underlying algorithms.
- Optimize the model to handle large-scale datasets efficiently and address challenges like overfitting and computational load.

## Key Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Use collaborative filtering methods to predict user preferences.
- **Matrix Factorization**: Implement techniques like Alternating Least Squares (ALS) and Gradient Descent (GD).
- **Regularization**: Integrate L2 regularization to mitigate overfitting and improve model generalization.
- **Model Optimization**: Apply sampling techniques to enhance training efficiency and reduce computational time for large datasets.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to evaluate and fine-tune the model for better performance.
