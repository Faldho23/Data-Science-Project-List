## Projects

1. [🏠 HDB Price Prediction](https://github.com/Faldho23/hdb-price-prediction)  
   - Analyzed HDB resale flat price trends in Singapore from 2015 to 2025 to build a prediction model that helps buyers and policymakers understand housing price movements
   - Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis
   - Applied PCA to reduce multicollinearity among features
   - Built and compared Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models
   - Evaluated model performance using RMSE
2. [💳 Fraud Detection Pipeline](https://github.com/Faldho23/Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection-with-Machine-Learning.git)
   - Developed a machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent online transactions, helping reduce financial loss and strengthen trust and safety in online payments
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand transaction patterns and class imbalance
   - Applied sampling techniques to handle highly imbalanced data
   - Trained and evaluated Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and LightGBM models
   - Focused on Recall and AUC-ROC as key metrics to minimize false negatives
3. [🏗️ Container Terminal Management Database](https://github.com/Faldho23/container-terminal-management-database.git)
   - Developed a relational database using SQL to manage container operations at a port terminal
   - Designed the relational schema and entity-relationship diagram to track ships, berths, containers, and yard locations
   - Populated the database with realistic test data and performed data validation to ensure smooth and accurate terminal operations
   - Implemented queries for scheduling, container movements, historical tracking, and reporting
