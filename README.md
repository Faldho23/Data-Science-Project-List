## Projects

1. [🏠 HDB Price Prediction](https://github.com/Faldho23/hdb-price-prediction)  
   - Analyzed HDB resale flat price trends in Singapore from 2015 to 2025 to build a prediction model that helps buyers and policymakers understand housing price movements
   - Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis
   - Applied PCA to reduce multicollinearity among features
   - Built and compared Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models
2. [💳 Fraud Detection Model](https://github.com/Faldho23/Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection-with-Machine-Learning.git)
   - Developed a machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent online transactions, helping reduce financial loss and strengthen trust and safety in online payments
   - Applied oversampling techniques to handle highly imbalanced data
   - Trained and evaluated Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and LightGBM models
3. [📊 DataGuru – Data Science Education Web App](https://github.com/Faldho23/data-science-education-website.git)
   - Developed a web platform to help JC students explore data science interests and choose suitable majors
   - Built a personalized quiz system using NLP models to recommend majors
   - Designed the frontend using ReactJS and integrated Flask APIs
   - Deployed the project with Docker to ensure easy setup and scalability
Deployed with Docker and optimized user experience based on student feedback
5. [🏗️ Container Terminal Management Database](https://github.com/Faldho23/container-terminal-management-database.git)
   - Developed a relational database using SQL to manage container operations at a port terminal
   - Designed the relational schema and entity-relationship diagram to track ships, berths, containers, and yard locations
   - Populated the database with realistic test data and performed data validation to ensure smooth and accurate terminal operations
   - Implemented queries for scheduling, container movements, historical tracking, and reporting
6. [🚢 Predicting Passengers’ Survivability in Shipwrecks](https://github.com/Faldho23/predicting-passengers-survivability-in-shipwrecks.git)
   - Developed machine learning models to predict passenger survival in shipwrecks, helping the SAR team prioritize rescue efforts and improve overall survival rates
   - Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns in passenger demographics and ticket information
   - Built and compared SVM and Logistic Regression classifiers
   - Provided insights to support data-driven decision-making in emergency rescue planning
